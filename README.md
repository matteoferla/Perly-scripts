# Perly-scripts
A load of old scripts, which I will finish uploading one day and add descriptions.
Few of them have PODs. And the documentation of many was lost with two successive hard drive failures.

Of interest is the shorthand of these two:
```
use constant N=>"\n";
use constant T=>"\t";
```

I still use it with Python. My pycharm infact adds a them as a default, expect with the commented out alternative N="<br/>".

I don't remember if it worked.

##Other stuff
A bit of everything, including scripts to analyse wikipedia MCB back in 2009. Yup. there is even a script that computes PCA in Perl and laplace.pl ain't no wrapper of the famous library.
